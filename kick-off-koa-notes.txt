Kick off koa

> 1. Create a koa server that listens on a port passed from the command line and replies with "hello koa" when an HTTP GET request is sent to /.

The workshop will execute requests against the server and verify the output.

Create a server that listens on a given port number with the following code:

    var koa = require('koa');
    var app = koa();
    
    // handlers here
    // app.use(handlers);
    
    app.listen(port);

You can get the port by

    var port = process.argv[2];

Handlers can be anonymous generate functions or separately declared (just like in javascript :P):

    app.use(function *() {
      // you can set the response body in handler like this
      this.body = 'hello';
    });
